                <h2>What kind of chickens do you want?</h2>
                <p>Take your time to select the chickens that will produce the color &amp; quantities of eggs that you desire. Some breeds will<br> produce more eggs than others. And the size the eggs can vary depending on the age and breed of the chicken. You may select <br> 
                smaller breeds for pets if eggs are not important to you. Or larger birds if you desire meat birds.</p>

                <p>Once your pullets have matured they will begin to lay eggs. The fresh eggs will complement any back yard<br> vegetable garden to make a <b>delicious</b> and healthy <b>breakfast.</b></p>
